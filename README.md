# Epherousa [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Sinderella/epherousa.svg?token=8Z4yehRhLixppVCDLLLp&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Sinderella/epherousa)

Epherousa (or Ephe in short) provides an automatic way of searching for available exploits and vulnerability information. Ultimately it should present the information in such a way that will help researchers and penetration testers with their day to day job. Both CVE and text-based searches are supported.

If installing from repositories, you can invoke epherousa from the command line either with her full name or with her short name ephe.
