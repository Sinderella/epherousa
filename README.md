Epherousa (or Ephe in short) provides an automatic way of searching for available exploits and vulnerability information. Ultimately it should present the information in such a way that will help researchers and penetration testers with their day to day job. Both CVE and text-based searches are supported.

Ephe's name stems from the Greek mythology. Pherousa (Φέρουσα) is the name of 2 different figures, one being a Nereid (sea female spirit) and the other being a Horae (godness of the seasons and time). Pherousa in Greek stands for "she who brings or carries", which hopefully in this case makes sense as ephe carries or brings your exploit and vulnerability information.

## INSTALLATION
